```

2. Run the Flask app:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser

- Just push to Heroku with Python buildpack

### Railway
- Connect your GitHub repo
- Railway will auto-detect the Python app

### Vercel/Netlify
- These are more suitable for static sites, use Render.com instead
